# AsciiArtGenerator
Automatically creates ascii art from an image, random term list, or url, hides source image until user reveals

Created with considerable help from ChatGP. This is a Visual Studio 2017 Project, using Win Forms, where all controls are created a runtime.

User can input a web url of an image, search term (scrapes an image from yahoo images), a file, or just click to create with a random search term seeded from the list you can see in the form1.cs, a random generated list of well known "rap artists", "famous americans", and "historical figures" that chatgpt provided.

The source image from which the ascii art is created is hidden by default, until the user clicks to reveal it, for fun.

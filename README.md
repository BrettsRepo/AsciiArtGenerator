# AsciiArtGenerator
Automatically creates ascii art from an image, random term list, or url, hides source image until user reveals

Created with considerable help from ChatGP. This is a Visual Studio 2017 Project, using Win Forms, where all controls are created a runtime.

User can input a web url of an image, search term (scrapes an image from yahoo images), a file, or just click to create with a random search term seeded from the list you can see in the form1.cs, a random generated list of "rap artists" and "famous americans" that chatgpt provided.

The source image is hidden by default, until the user clicks to reveal it, for fun.
